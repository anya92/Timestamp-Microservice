  h1 API TIMESTAMP MICROSERVICE
  h2 User stories:
  p 1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
  p 2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
  p 3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
  
  h2 Example usage:
  code https://anya92-timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/January%208,%202017
